Detects all faces in a photo and slides on a pair of pixel shades. Truly a worthwhile use of the bountiful technological feast made possible by machine learning and artificial intelligence. Deal with it.

### What's under the hood
- [Project Oxford for Node](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/project-oxford) calls the [Microsoft Face API](http://microsoft.com/cognitive) to return angle, pitch, and coordinates of eyes and eyebrows for each face detected (max. 64).
- [socket.io](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io) handles communication between the node server and client HTML.
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) takes care of a few things like the generation and animation of glasses.
If you want to play with this code on your own, you'll need to add your own [API key](http://microsoft.com/cognitive) for the Face API.
